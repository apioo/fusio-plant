# Fusio Plant

Fusio Plant is an open-source server panel to easily self-host apps on your server.
It can be seen as a modern alternative to tools like cPanel with a simple,
performant and clean tech-stack.

## Goals

* Run multiple apps cost efficiently on your server
* Provide a web-based admin panel to manage and monitor all apps
* Exposes a REST API to control your server
* Automatically obtain SSL certificates with certbot
* Keep your server clean and lightweight, we basically only install Nginx and Docker

## Non-Goals

* Run apps across multiple hosts, for this you should take a look at [Kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io/)

## Installation

To install Fusio Plant on your server you only need to execute the `install.sh` script as root.
Note currently only Ubuntu as OS is supported, we recommend running this script on a fresh Ubuntu
installation. Download and run the `install.sh` script with the following command:

```
curl -s https://raw.githubusercontent.com/apioo/fusio-plant/refs/heads/main/install.sh | bash
```

The script installs on your server only Nginx, Docker and the Fusio Plant executor, all other
apps and also Plant itself will run as docker container.

Note: On installation the "install" script asks for a domain of your server. Please make sure
that the DNS A/AAAA record of your domain already points to your server. The domain is needed since
the installer registers a random sub-domain for your app and API. For example, if you provided the
domain `myawesome.app` the installer configures two sub-domains:

* App: `plant-7546c3d1-f47f-47c9-8e1a-177536254a58.myawesome.app`
* API: `api-7546c3d1-f47f-47c9-8e1a-177536254a58.myawesome.app`

The random part is a UUID generated randomly for every installation. This is just a security layer
so that it is more challenging to access the backend app and API to control your server.
If you access the app, you still need to authenticate with the username and password which was
generated by the installation script.

## Folder

The following list covers all important folders of your Plant server.

### /docker

Contains all projects and each project contains a `docker-compose.yml` file.

### /opt/plant

Contains the plant executor which receives commands through the `/opt/plant/input` folder and
writes responses back to the `/opt/plant/output` folder. Since the plant app also runs in a
container those folders are mounted into the plant app and help to execute commands on the
host. The executor is a simple bash script that listens for file changes in this folder,
you can see all commands at the [executor script](./executor.sh).

### /cache

The cache folder which is used in case [Nginx content caching](https://docs.nginx.com/nginx/admin-guide/content-cache/content-caching/)
is activated.
